      Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do, like rappers do) <br>
      Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (they wasn't cool, they wasn't cool) <br>

      Go at a reverend for the revenue <br>
      It go Halle Berry or hallelujah <br>
      Pick your poison tell me what you do <br>
      Everybody gon' respect the shooter <br>
      But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun forever) <br>
      And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way <br>
      Through canals and alleyways, just to say <br>
      Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel (now, now) <br>
      A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel (now) <br>
      A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel (now, now) <br>
      A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel (now) <br>
      A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel <br>
      Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do, like rappers do) <br>
      Bump that new E-40 at the school (way at the school, way at the school) <br>
      You know big ballin' with my homies (my homies) <br>
      Earl Stevens had us thinking rational (Thinking rational, that's rational) <br>
      Back to reality we poor, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish) <br>
      Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish) <br>
      Two bullets in my uncle Tony head (my Tony head, my Tony head) <br>
      He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish) <br>
      That Louis Burger never be the same (won't be the same, won't be the same) <br>
      A louis belt will never ease that pain (won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain) <br>
      But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', day is jerkin') <br>
      Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin' (Pirelli's skirtin', Pirelli's skirtin') <br>
      Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish) <br>
      Hoping all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish) <br>
      They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold, a pot of gold) <br>
      And we gone crash it when nobodies home <br>

      Be the last one out to get this dough? No way <br>
      Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way <br>
      Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way <br>
      Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way <br>
      Be the last one out to get this dough? No way <br>
      Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way <br>
      Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way <br>
      Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way <br>
      Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets <br>
      Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping <br>
      Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving <br>
      My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him <br>
      Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustlin' <br>
      What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government? <br>
      Gotta provide for my daughter 'n' 'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch <br>
      Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch <br>
      Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash <br>
      If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass <br>
      From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood <br>
      Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good <br>
      Broken promises, steal yo' watch and tell you what time it is <br>
      Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is <br>
      In the streets with a heater under my dungarees <br>
      Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree <br>
      It go Halle Berry or hallelujah <br>
      Pick your poison tell me what you do <br>
      Everybody gon' respect the shooter <br>
      But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun forever) <br>
      And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way <br>
      Through canals and alleyways, just to say <br>
      Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel <br></p>
